    All integers are Big Endians.

    The SVG Data of each Frame is gzipped.

    If the Framesize of a Frame is NULL (0x0), then
    no new Frame must be rendered. Instead, the last
    active Frame will remain active for the following
    Repeat Amount Frames, inclusively.
	
    If The Audiosize of the Audio is NULL (0x0), then
    no Audio will be loaded/played.
